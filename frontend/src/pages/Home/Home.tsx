        <p>
          This assignment is aimed at testing your ability to solve a coding challenge using React.js, Sass, and Typescript technologies. The interviewer will explain the task and you will have the chance to ask questions.
        </p>

          Your task is to create an online store to showcase our clients' products to their customers.

          Already set up for you is a products endpoint: <span className="code">/api/get-products</span> which will return an array of products.
        </p>
        <p>You will need to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Display the products</li>
            <li>Allow customers to add and remove products from their basket</li>
            <li>Display the total cost of the customer's basket</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Good styling and design is not a requirement but feel free to showcase your abilities if you wish.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please remember to write tests for any features you create.
        </p>
        <p>Good luckðŸ¤ž</p>
