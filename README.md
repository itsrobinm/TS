# Frontend Interview Test - Online Store
This assignment is aimed at testing your ability to solve a coding challenge using React.js, Sass, and Typescript technologies. The interviewer will explain the task and you will have the chance to ask questions.

Your task is to create an online store to showcase our clients' products to their customers.

Already set up for you is a products endpoint: ```/api/get-products``` which will return an array of products.

You will need to:
- Dislay the products
- Allow customers to add and remove products from their basket
- Display the total cost of the customer's basket

Good styling and design is not a requirement but feel free to showcase your abilities if you wish.

Please remember to write tests for any features you create.

Good luckðŸ¤ž
